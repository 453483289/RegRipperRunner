# Filters #
Filters are designed to group plugins so that data specific to particular case types or hives can be quickly and easily identified. For example fraud cases could have a Filter defined that extracts document related registry information using plugins that deal with MRU lists.
Filters are simply files without file extensions that are loaded from the regripper plugins directory. Various filter related actions can be utilised via the plugin lists context menu. Note that the context menu is only enabled when the Mode is set to Filter.

The context menu allows the user to perform the following actions:

- Add plugins to the filter
- Delete plugins from the filter
- Create new filters
- Refresh the filters

## Add Plugins ##

## Delete Plugins ##

To delete plugins from a filter:

- Select the appropriate filter from the drop down list
- Select the plugins to be added using the CTRL or SHIFT keys
- Choose the Filter->Delete context menu option. The plugins will be removed from the filter file

## Create New Filter ##

To create a new filter:

- Select the plugins to be added using the CTRL or SHIFT keys
- Choose the Filter->New context menu option. The new filter window will be displayed
- Enter the name for the new filter
- Click the OK button, the new filter file will be created. The application will then load the new filter
