===============

## Info ##

RegRipperRunner is to replace the functionality of my RegExtract tool e.g. run plugin, run hive, run folder but using Harlan regripper, which means it has the same functionality and plugins without me having to write plugins. It also by proxy includes some of the plugin browser (pb.pl) and rr.pl functionality/
